## App ToDo

### A Simple ToDo Application

This simple application is meant to demonstrate the basics of HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript for educational purposes. App Todo demonstrates essentials to how to
properly structure HTML, specifically forms, basic styling using CSS,
particularly flexbox, and also how to implement essential CRUD (Create,
Read, Update, Delete) functions with JavaScript, using local storage.

**NOTE**

This application is very basic, and is intended for deonstration purposes for a
future blog post over at [my website](https://brianhayes.dev).
