## App ToDo

### A Simple ToDo Application

This simple application is meant to demonstrate the basics of HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript for educational purposes. App Todo demonstrates essentials to how to
properly structure HTML, specifically forms, basic styling using CSS,
particularly flexbox, and also how to implement essential CRUD (Create,
Read, Update, Delete) functions with JavaScript, using local storage.

### Installation

Because this application is so basic, installation is as simple as cloning
this repository!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomit4/app_todo
```

Once cloned, just `cd` into the `app_todo` directory and open up the index.html
in your browser. Should you wish to play around with the code yourself, you of
course can use live-server, either from the [command line](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) or the [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
extension.

```bash
cd app_todo & live-server .
```

From here you should be able to interact with a very essential todo application.
